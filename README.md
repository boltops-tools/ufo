Ufo is a tool that eases the building and deployment of docker images to [AWS ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/).  The main command is `ufo ship`.  Here's summary of what it does:

1. Builds a docker image. 
2. Generates and registers the ECS template definition. 
3. Deploys the ECS template definition to the ECS service.

Ufo deploys a task definition that is written in a templating language that is easily and fully controllable.

See [ufoships.com](http://ufoships.com) for full documentation.

## Important

If you are on version 2, you can run `ufo upgrade3` within your project to upgrade it to version 3.  Refer to the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

## Installation

    gem install ufo

Full installation instructions are at [Install Ufo](http://ufoships.com/docs/install/).

## Quick Start

To quickly demonstrate how simple it is to use ufo we will use an example app from [tongueroo/hi](https://github.com/tongueroo/ufo).  The app is a barebones sinatra app.  Here are the steps:

    gem install ufo
    git clone https:///github.com/tongueroo/hi.git
    cd hi
    ufo init --app=hi --image=tongueroo/hi
    ufo ship hi-web

Congratulations, you have successfully used ufo to deploy to an ECS service.

## Load Balancer Support

Ufo can also create a load balancer as part of creating the ECS service if you wish. Underneath the hood, ufo uses the [balancer](https://github.com/tongueroo/balancer) gem, to create the load balancer.  More information can be found at the [load balancer support docs](http://ufoships.com/docs/load-balancer/).
